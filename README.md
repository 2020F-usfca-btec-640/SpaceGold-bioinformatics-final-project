#### Overview
There has been conflicting information about herd immunity out of the Manaous, Amazonas, Brazil.
This project is a demo of a generalizable analysis pipeline of Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and tabular geographical data.

#### Analysis
Examples
* Inspect 70+ Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) from Brazilian Amazon
  * Compare for mutations
  * [Describe mutations over time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA662684)
* Inspect infection and herd immunity data
  * [Compare Manaus and SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20194787v1.full.pdf)
  * Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
  * Infection fatality ratio
* Summarize Manaous status
  * Risk factors
  * Herd immunity
  * Upshot
